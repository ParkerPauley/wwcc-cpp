# The Undead Village
## How to Play
- As a player, you will be prompted to enter a number (Normally 1, 2, or 3) to choose an action
- For example, in combat, you can type 1 and hit Enter to attack your enemy

## Story Synopsis
- You wake up, only remembering your name and nothing else
- You come to find out the world is under threat by the undead, and you are asked to help fend them off from a small village

## Controls
- Enter numbers to make choices

## Features Implemented
- int, bool, & string variables
- if/else and switch conditions
- while loops
- Functions
- Array
- Struct
- File reading and writing

## File Structure
- main.cpp: Main game code
- game_summary.txt: Summary of events

## Challenges faced
- Had issues with the combat system and trying to make sure player health was subtracted *every* time they were attacked, to accomplish this, I calculated the health decrease separately from the function, and it ended up working

## Future Improvements
### I would like to add/improve on:
- Player choices and the impact of those choices
- More items and weapons
- More choices in combat
- Expanded story elements
